# Face Mask Detection Model

Welcome to my repository for the Face Mask Detection project. This machine learning model aims to classify whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. I've developed this during my internship at SYNC INTERN'S, applying my skills in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and creating an interactive interface using Gradio.

In the face of a global pandemic, this project contributes towards ensuring safety protocols are followed and helps automate the process of face mask detection. The model was trained and tested using an extensive and diverse dataset, ensuring robustness and reliability.

You can try out the model through the Gradio interface or delve into the code to understand the mechanics of the model. This repository contains all relevant files, including the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics.
